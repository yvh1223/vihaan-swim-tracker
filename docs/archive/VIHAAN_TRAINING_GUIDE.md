## Where You'll Find the Time

### For ALL Events - The Big 5

These **5 things** will make you faster in EVERY event:

#### 1. 🌊 Underwater Kicks (Biggest Time Saver!)
**What it means**: After you dive and after every turn, stay underwater longer with powerful kicks.

**How much time you'll save**: 0.5 to 1.5 seconds PER RACE!

**Why it works**: Moving underwater is faster than swimming on top of the water because there's no wave resistance.

**Your goal**:
- After starts: 6-10 kicks before surfacing (reach the flags - 15 feet)
- After turns: 4-6 kicks before surfacing (reach 10-12 feet)

---

#### 2. 🚀 Explosive Starts
**What it means**: Dive hard, enter the water deep, and stay streamlined.

**How much time you'll save**: 0.3 to 0.7 seconds!

**Why it works**: A good start can beat swimmers who have better strokes because you build speed immediately.

**Your goal**:
- Powerful leg drive off the blocks
- Enter water at an angle (like an arrow, not a belly flop)
- Tight streamline with arms locked over your head

---

#### 3. ⚡ Perfect Turns
**What it means**: Fast flip (or touch), quick feet to wall, explosive push-off.

**How much time you'll save**: 0.2 to 0.5 seconds per turn!

**Why it works**: Slower turns break your momentum. Fast turns keep your speed.

**Your goal**:
- Don't breathe the last 2 strokes going into the wall
- Quick flip or two-hand touch
- Push off HARD with underwater kicks

---

#### 4. 🏃 Fast Stroke Rate
**What it means**: Move your arms faster without pausing.

**How much time you'll save**: 0.5 to 1.5 seconds!

**Why it works**: The more strokes you take per second, the faster you go (without losing distance per stroke).

**Your goal**:
- Keep your arms moving continuously
- Don't glide too long between strokes
- Quick recovery over the water

---

#### 5. 💪 Strong Finishes
**What it means**: Your last 3 strokes should be your FASTEST strokes.

**How much time you'll save**: 0.1 to 0.3 seconds!

**Why it works**: Many swimmers slow down at the end. You can pass them!

**Your goal**:
- Don't breathe the last 2 strokes
- Sprint to the wall
- Lunge and touch with a long reach

---

## Event-Specific Time Savers

### 50 BR SCY - Need 2.01 seconds for A time

**The Perfect Pullout**:
1. Push off the wall in streamline position
2. Pull your hands all the way down to your hips (BIG pull)
3. Hold your arms at your sides for 1 second (don't rush!)
4. Do ONE huge breaststroke kick
5. Glide as far as you can before you HAVE to breathe
6. Surface around the flags (15 feet from the wall)

**Where you'll find 2 seconds**:
1. **Perfect pullout** → **-0.60 sec**
2. **Better stroke** (longer glide, faster kick) → **-0.80 sec**

### 100 BK SCY - Need 4.41 seconds for A time

## Important Things to Remember

### 1. Technique > Speed (at your age)
Perfect technique now will make you MUCH faster when you're older. Don't sacrifice good form just to go fast.

### 2. Underwaters Are EVERYTHING
If you only practice ONE thing from this plan, practice underwater kicks. They're the biggest time saver!

### 3. Every Turn Matters
In a 50, you have 1 turn. In a 100, you have 1 turn. Make it count! A bad turn can cost you 0.5 seconds.

### 4. Don't Breathe Into Walls
The last 2 strokes before every wall = NO BREATHING. This keeps your speed up.

### 5. Last 3 Strokes = FASTEST
Finish strong! Sprint the last 3 strokes to the wall.

### 6. Rest and Recover
You need 9-10 hours of sleep every night. Your body grows and gets stronger when you sleep!

### 7. Have Fun!
Swimming should be fun! These goals are exciting challenges, not pressure.
