## ⏱️ 1-HOUR PRACTICE PLAN

### Part 1: Warm-Up (10 min)

**Purpose**: Get muscles warm, prepare for butterfly work.

**How to do it**:
- [ ] **200 yards easy freestyle**
  - **What this means**: 8 lengths of the pool (down and back 4 times)
  - Swim at comfortable pace, breathe normally
  - **Parent**: Let him swim at his own pace, no timing
  - **Takes about**: 4-5 minutes

- [ ] **4 x 25 butterfly easy**
  - **What this means**: Swim 25 yards (1 length) butterfly, 4 times
  - Easy pace - just feel the rhythm, don't sprint
  - **"Easy"** = about 50-60% effort, comfortable
  - Rest 15-20 seconds between each
  - **Parent**: Watch his stroke - smooth and relaxed, not straining
  - **Takes about**: 3 minutes

- [ ] **4 x 25 choice** (any stroke)
  - Mix it up: maybe 1 FR, 1 BK, 1 BR, 1 FL
  - Keep it easy and loose
  - **Takes about**: 2-3 minutes

**Total warm-up**: About 10 minutes

---

### Part 2: UNDERWATER DOLPHIN KICKS (20 min) ⭐ MOST IMPORTANT!

**Why this is critical**: Underwater kicks will save you 0.20 seconds - that's MORE THAN HALF of what you need!

**What "underwater dolphin kicks" means**:
- Both legs move together up and down (like a mermaid or dolphin)
- **"Streamline"** = arms straight above head, hands stacked, squeezing ears, body straight like an arrow
- Stay underwater as long as possible, kicking powerfully
- Goal: Reach 15 feet (the flags) before surfacing!

---

**SET 1: With fins** (if you have them) - 10 minutes

- [ ] **8 x 15 yards underwater kick on :45**

**How to do it (for Vihaan)**:
1. Start at the wall
2. Push off HARD in perfect streamline position
3. Do dolphin kicks - kick from your HIPS, not just knees
4. Count in your head: 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8
5. Try to reach the flags (15 feet) before you breathe
6. When you MUST breathe, come up
7. Swim back to the start (or walk back along the side)
8. Rest until 45 seconds from when you started
9. Repeat 8 times

**Parent's job**:
- Stand at the 15-foot mark (at the flags) where Vihaan can see you
- Count his kicks OUT LOUD as he's underwater: "ONE! TWO! THREE! FOUR! FIVE! SIX! SEVEN! EIGHT!"
- When he surfaces, tell him:
  - "Great! You did 8 kicks and made it past the flags!" OR
  - "Good! You did 6 kicks and got to 12 feet - try for one more kick next time!"
- Use your phone's stopwatch - he should start the next one every 45 seconds
- **Encouragement is key!** "You're getting stronger!" "That was your best one yet!"

**What GOOD technique looks like**:
- ✅ Arms perfectly straight, squeezed tight to ears
- ✅ Body in straight line (no bend at waist)
- ✅ Kicks from hips (whole legs moving)
- ✅ Powerful kicks (you should see water moving!)
- ✅ Stays 1-2 feet underwater (not at surface)

**Common mistakes**:
- ❌ Arms not squeezed to ears (creates drag)
- ❌ Head lifted (should be down between arms)
- ❌ Kicking only from knees (weak kicks)
- ❌ Coming up too early (before 10 feet)

---

**SET 2: Without fins** (race conditions) - 10 minutes

- [ ] **8 x 15 yards underwater kick on :60**

**How to do it (for Vihaan)**:
- Same as with fins, but WITHOUT fins (this is harder!)
- Goal: 5-6 solid kicks, reach 12-15 feet
- This is EXACTLY what you'll do in the race tomorrow!
- Rest 60 seconds between each (more rest because it's harder)

**Parent's job**:
- Same as fins set: stand at flags, count kicks
- This will be harder - he won't go as far
- **Keep encouraging!** "That was hard without fins - you did great!"
- "In the race tomorrow, just do exactly this!"
- Count kicks: aim for 5-6 strong kicks minimum

**Expected results**:
- With fins: Should reach 15 feet (flags) or beyond
- Without fins: Should reach 12-15 feet with 5-6 kicks

---

### Part 3: STARTS FROM BLOCKS (15 min) ⭐ CRITICAL!

**Why this is critical**: A good start can save you 0.15-0.20 seconds!

- [ ] **10-12 butterfly starts**

**How to do it (for Vihaan)**:
1. Stand on starting blocks (or pool edge if no blocks)
2. Toes at edge, feet shoulder-width apart
3. Bend down, grab front edge with hands
4. When ready, say "GO!"
5. **PUSH HARD with legs** - explode off the blocks!
6. Throw arms forward, point them like an arrow
7. **Enter water at angle** - dive DOWN into water, not flat
8. Immediately get into streamline (hands stacked, arms squeezing ears)
9. Do **5-6 dolphin kicks** underwater
10. When you reach 15 feet (flags), start swimming butterfly
11. Swim to the wall (or just take 2-3 strokes and stop)
12. Get out, walk back, rest 45-60 seconds
13. Repeat 10-12 times

**Parent's job (VERY IMPORTANT)**:
- **Safety first**: Make sure pool is at least 6 feet deep for diving. If not, practice from pool edge pushing off.
- Stand where you can see him enter the water
- **Time each start**:
  - Start timer when his feet leave the blocks
  - Stop timer when his head breaks the surface to breathe
  - **Goal time**: 4-5 seconds from start to surface
- Count his kicks OUT LOUD: "1-2-3-4-5-6!"
- Watch where he surfaces - should be at or past the flags (15 feet)

**What GOOD start looks like**:
- ✅ Powerful leg push (you hear/see the explosion off blocks)
- ✅ Enters water hands-first at 45-degree angle (like arrow)
- ✅ Small splash (not belly flop)
- ✅ Immediately streamlines underwater
- ✅ 5-6 powerful kicks visible underwater
- ✅ Surfaces at 15 feet (the flags)
- ✅ Takes 4-5 seconds from start to surface

**Common mistakes**:
- ❌ Weak push off blocks (not using full leg power)
- ❌ Enters flat (belly flop - big splash)
- ❌ Arms not straight when entering
- ❌ Only does 2-3 kicks (needs 5-6!)
- ❌ Comes up too early (before 12 feet)

**What to say**:
- If good: "Perfect! 5 kicks, reached the flags, 4.3 seconds - that's race-ready!"
- If needs work: "Good push! Next time try to get one more kick before surfacing"
- Always end positive: "You're getting better every time!"

**Keep track**: Write down his best time: _____ seconds

---

### Part 4: FAST BUTTERFLY TURNS (10 min)

**Why this matters**: A fast turn can save 0.08 seconds!

- [ ] **8 x 50 butterfly - focus on the turn**

**How to do it (for Vihaan)**:
1. Swim easy butterfly to the wall (first 25)
2. **IMPORTANT - Last 2 strokes before wall: NO BREATHING!**
3. Touch wall with BOTH hands at the SAME TIME (this is a rule!)
4. Quick tuck - pull knees to chest FAST
5. Plant feet on wall
6. Push off HARD on your side or back (not on belly!)
7. Do 3-4 dolphin kicks underwater
8. Surface at about 10 feet from the wall
9. Swim easy butterfly to the other end (second 25)
10. Rest 20-30 seconds
11. Repeat 8 times

**Parent's job**:
- Stand at the wall where you can see the turn
- Watch for BOTH hands touching at the same time (if only one hand touches, it's illegal in a race!)
- Count how fast the turn is: from touch to push-off should be about 1 second
- Count the kicks after the turn: should see 3-4 kicks
- Watch where he surfaces: should be about 10 feet from the wall

**What GOOD turn looks like**:
- ✅ No breath on last 2 strokes (head stays down)
- ✅ Both hands touch wall at same time
- ✅ Quick tuck (knees to chest in less than 1 second)
- ✅ Explosive push off wall
- ✅ 3-4 powerful dolphin kicks
- ✅ Surfaces at 10 feet

**Common mistakes**:
- ❌ Breathes right before wall (slows down)
- ❌ Only one hand touches wall (illegal!)
- ❌ Slow tuck (wastes time)
- ❌ Weak push off wall
- ❌ Only 1-2 kicks (needs 3-4!)

**What to say**:
- "Perfect two-hand touch! Quick turn! I counted 4 kicks!"
- "Good, but remember - no breathing those last 2 strokes into the wall"
- "That turn was super fast! Do that in the race tomorrow!"

### Part 5: RACE SIMULATION (5 min) ⭐ THE REAL DEAL!

**Why this is THE MOST IMPORTANT part**: This is your practice race for tomorrow!

- [ ] **2-3 x 50 butterfly ALL OUT** (Rest 3 minutes between each)

**How to do it (for Vihaan)**:

**RACE #1, #2, and #3**:
1. Start from blocks (just like the real race tomorrow!)
2. **EXPLOSIVE start** - push HARD off blocks
3. Enter water deep, streamline immediately
4. **5-6 dolphin kicks** - count them! Reach the flags!
5. Surface and start swimming butterfly
6. Swim FAST but with GOOD technique to the wall
7. **Last 2 strokes - NO BREATHING!**
8. **TWO-HAND TOUCH** on the wall
9. Quick tuck, push off HARD
10. **3-4 dolphin kicks** off the turn
11. Surface at 10 feet
12. **SPRINT the last 25 yards!**
13. **Last 2 strokes into finish - NO BREATHING!**
14. **TOUCH the wall!**

**Parent's job (CRITICAL - THIS IS THE PRACTICE RACE!)**:

**Timing**:
- Have your phone ready with stopwatch
- **Start timer**: When his feet leave the blocks
- **Stop timer**: When his hand touches the wall at finish
- Write down EACH time immediately!

**What to watch for (use this checklist)**:
- [ ] Did he push hard off the blocks? (explosive start?)
- [ ] Did he enter the water at an angle? (not flat?)
- [ ] Did he do 5-6 kicks off the start? (count them!)
- [ ] Did he reach the flags? (15 feet?)
- [ ] Did he NOT breathe last 2 strokes into the turn?
- [ ] Did BOTH hands touch the wall?
- [ ] Was the turn quick? (fast tuck and push?)
- [ ] Did he do 3-4 kicks off the turn?
- [ ] Did he SPRINT the last 25?
- [ ] Did he NOT breathe last 2 strokes into the finish?

**Record the times**:
- Try #1: __________ seconds
- Try #2: __________ seconds
- Try #3: __________ seconds

**Target time**: 41-42 seconds (close to goal of 41.29!)

**After EACH race**:
1. Tell him his time immediately: "You did 41.8 seconds!"
2. Compare to his current best (41.63): "That's only 0.17 seconds slower - you're so close!"
3. Give specific feedback on what you saw:
   - "Your start was perfect! I counted 6 kicks and you reached the flags!"
   - "Great turn! Both hands touched and you got right off that wall!"
   - "Your sprint at the end was excellent!"
4. If he needs improvement on something, tell him for the next try:
   - "Next time, try to get one more kick off the start"
   - "Remember - no breathing those last 2 strokes before the turn"
5. **Encouragement**: "You're ready for tomorrow! Just do exactly what you did here!"

**Rest 3 minutes between each race** - he can sit, drink water, catch his breath. This is important - he needs to be fresh for each try.

**After all 3 tries**:
- Look at the times - which was fastest?
- "Your best time today was _____ ! That's awesome!"
- "Tomorrow in the race, just swim like you did on try #2 (or whichever was best)"
- "You've practiced everything - starts, underwaters, turns, and sprinting. You're ready!"

### THE RACE - 50 BUTTERFLY

**Remember the 3 Secrets to Success**:

**Secret #1**: 6 kicks off the start → reach the flags!
**Secret #2**: Don't breathe last 2 strokes into walls
**Secret #3**: SPRINT the last 25 yards!

**The Race Plan** (what Vihaan should think about):

**Before getting on the blocks**:
- Take off your sweats at the last minute
- Adjust your goggles (make sure they're tight!)
- Shake out your arms
- One more deep breath
- Think: "I've practiced this. I'm ready. I can do this!"

**On the blocks**:
- Step up when they call your heat
- Toes at the edge
- Grab the front of the block
- Listen for "Take your mark..."
- Get ready position (bent down, ready to explode)
- Wait for the beep... **GO!!!**

**THE START** (0-15 feet):
1. **EXPLODE off the blocks!** (push HARD with your legs!)
2. Enter water deep (hands first, like an arrow going down)
3. **Tight streamline** (arms locked, squeeze ears)
4. **Count your kicks**: 1-2-3-4-5-6 (dolphin kicks!)
5. Reach the flags (15 feet) before surfacing
6. This alone saves you 0.20 seconds!

**FIRST 25** (swimming to the turn):
1. Start swimming butterfly (strong, smooth strokes)
2. High elbows when your arms come out of the water
3. Quick recovery (hands move fast over the water)
4. Breathe every 2 or 3 strokes (find your rhythm)
5. **IMPORTANT**: Last 2 strokes before the wall - NO BREATHING!
6. Keep your head down and swim fast into the wall

**THE TURN** (at 25 yards):
1. Touch wall with **BOTH hands** at the same time (very important!)
2. Quick tuck (pull knees to chest FAST!)
3. Plant feet on wall
4. Push off HARD (as hard as you can!)
5. **3-4 dolphin kicks** off the turn
6. Surface at about 10 feet from the wall
7. This saves you 0.08 seconds!

**LAST 25** (the sprint!):
1. This is where you WIN!
2. **SPRINT** - swim as fast as you can!
3. High elbows, quick hands
4. Fast arms - don't slow down!
5. Last 10 yards - FASTEST swimming of the whole race!
6. **IMPORTANT**: Last 2 strokes - NO BREATHING!
7. Keep your head down
8. **LUNGE** to the wall (reach out as far as you can!)
9. **TOUCH!!!**

**After you touch**:
1. Look at the clock - what's your time?
2. Breathe! (You probably held your breath a lot!)
3. Remember your time
4. Get out of the pool when the official tells you
5. Check the scoreboard for your official time
