## ⚖️ BALANCE LEFT & RIGHT SIDES (Important!)

**Problem**: Right hand and right leg are stronger than left side.

**Solution**: Do these drills EVERY practice to make your left side stronger:

**1. One-Arm Drills** (10 min)
- [ ] **6 x 25 LEFT ARM ONLY** (any stroke on :45)
  - Right arm stays at your side or extended forward
  - Focus on making your LEFT arm pull as strong as your right
  - Do this for freestyle, backstroke, or butterfly

**2. Single-Leg Kick** (5 min)
- [ ] **4 x 25 LEFT LEG ONLY kick** (with kickboard on :50)
  - Right leg stays still
  - Kick HARD with left leg only
  - Makes your left leg stronger

**3. Breathe to Your Left Side** (during all freestyle practice)
- If you normally breathe to the right, practice breathing to the LEFT
- This strengthens your left side pull
- Try breathing every 3 strokes (right-left-right-left pattern)

**Why this helps**: By working your left side MORE, it will catch up to your right side and you'll swim straighter and faster!

## 🌊 UNIVERSAL FOCUS POINTS (Apply to ALL Strokes)

These 5 things will make you faster in EVERY event. Focus on them during EVERY practice!

### 1. UNDERWATER KICKS (Biggest Time Saver!)

**What it means**: After you dive or push off a wall, stay underwater longer with strong kicks.

**Simple explanation**:
- **"Off start"** = right after you dive into the pool from the starting blocks
- **"Off turn"** = right after you push off the wall when you turn around
- Instead of coming up right away, you stay under the water and do dolphin kicks (like a dolphin or mermaid swims, both legs together moving up and down)

**Why it saves time**: Moving underwater is faster than swimming on top because there's no wave resistance (no waves slowing you down).

**Where you save time**: 0.5 to 1.5 seconds per race!

**What to do during practice**:
- Every time you push off a wall → do 5-6 strong kicks BEFORE you start swimming
- **"Streamline"** = arms straight above your head, one hand on top of the other, squeezing your ears with your arms, body stretched out like an arrow
- Count your kicks underwater: 1-2-3-4-5-6
- **"The flags"** = those triangle flags hanging over the pool about 15 feet (5 yards) from each wall
- Try to stay underwater and reach the flags before you start swimming
- During warm-up, during drills, during cool-down - EVERY wall!

---

### 2. EXPLOSIVE STARTS

**What it means**: Dive hard, enter deep, stay streamlined.

**Why it saves time**: A good start builds speed immediately.

**Where you save time**: 0.3 to 0.7 seconds!

**What to do during practice**:
- When practicing starts: Push HARD off blocks
- Enter water at an angle (dive down, not flat)
- Tight streamline (arms locked over head, squeeze your ears)
- 5-6 kicks before first stroke

**For 50 FL goal**: This can save you 0.15 seconds!

---

### 3. FAST TURNS

**What it means**: Quick flip or touch, explosive push-off.

**Simple explanation**:
- **"Turn"** = when you reach the wall and need to go back the other way
- **"Flip turn"** = (for freestyle/backstroke) you do a somersault in the water, plant your feet on the wall, and push off on your back or side
- **"Touch turn"** = (for butterfly/breaststroke) you touch the wall with BOTH hands at the same time, then tuck your knees, plant your feet, and push off
- **"Don't breathe into walls"** = when you're swimming toward the wall, don't take a breath on your last 2 strokes - keep your head down and swim fast into the wall

**Why it saves time**: Slow turns break your momentum (you lose your speed).

**Where you save time**: 0.2 to 0.5 seconds per turn!

**What to do during practice**:
- Last 2 strokes before the wall = no breathing (keep your head down)
- **Freestyle/backstroke**: Do a quick flip (somersault), feet on wall, push hard
- **Butterfly/breaststroke**: Touch with both hands at the same time, quick tuck, push hard
- Push off HARD (like you're trying to push the wall away)
- 4-6 underwater kicks after every turn (stay underwater and kick before you start swimming again)

**For 50 FL goal**: This can save you 0.08 seconds!

---

### 4. FAST STROKE RATE

**What it means**: Move your arms faster without pausing.

**Simple explanation**:
- **"Stroke rate"** = how fast your arms move (how many arm pulls you do in one minute)
- **"High stroke tempo"** = same as fast stroke rate - your arms are moving quickly, like a fast drum beat
- **"Turnover speed"** = how quickly one arm finishes pulling and the next arm starts pulling
- **"Don't glide"** = don't let your arms pause or stop between strokes - keep them moving all the time
- Think of it like pedaling a bike - you want to pedal fast, not slow with long pauses

**Why it saves time**: More strokes per second = faster swimming.

**Where you save time**: 0.5 to 1.5 seconds!

**What to do during practice**:
- Keep your arms moving continuously (don't stop or pause)
- Don't glide too long between strokes (start your next stroke right away)
- **"Quick recovery"** = when your arm comes out of the water, move it forward quickly to start the next stroke
- During sprint sets: focus on moving your arms as fast as you can

---

### 5. STRONG FINISHES

**What it means**: Last 3 strokes should be your FASTEST strokes.

**Simple explanation**:
- **"Sprint"** = swim as fast as you can, like running as fast as you can
- **"Last 10 yards"** = the last little bit before you touch the wall (about 10 big steps if you were walking)
- When you can see the wall getting close, that's when you swim your absolute fastest
- **"Lunge"** = reach your arm out as far as you can to touch the wall, like trying to touch something just barely out of reach

**Why it saves time**: Many swimmers slow down at the end - you can pass them!

**Where you save time**: 0.1 to 0.3 seconds!

**What to do during practice**:
- Every time you swim to the wall: sprint the last 10 yards (swim super fast!)
- Don't breathe the last 2 strokes (keep your head down, swim fast to the wall)
- Lunge and touch with a long reach (stretch your arm out far to touch the wall)

## 🦋 50 BUTTERFLY - SPECIFIC FOCUS

**For Nov 8 Meet** (Focus on this AFTER Nov 1-2)

**Current**: 41.63 | **Goal**: 41.29 | **Need**: -0.34 seconds

### What to Focus on During Team Butterfly Practice:

**1. Underwater Kicks (THE BIGGEST SAVER!)**
- Off the start: 5-6 strong dolphin kicks → reach flags (15 feet)
- Off the turn: 3-4 strong kicks → reach 10 feet
- **Time saved**: -0.20 seconds!

**2. High Elbow Recovery**

**Simple explanation**:
- **"Recovery"** = when your arms come OUT of the water and move forward to start the next stroke
- **"High elbow"** = when your arms are out of the water, your elbows should be higher than your hands (like you're showing your muscles!)
- **"Fingertips skim the water"** = your fingertips lightly touch the top of the water as your arms swing forward
- **"Quick hands over water"** = move your arms forward fast when they're out of the water

**What it looks like**: Imagine your elbows are wings flying high, and your fingertips are just dragging along the water surface

**Time saved**: -0.06 seconds from better stroke

**3. Fast Butterfly Turns**
- Touch wall with BOTH hands at the same time
- Quick tuck (knees to chest)
- Push off on your side or back
- 3-4 kicks before surfacing
- **Time saved**: -0.08 seconds!

**4. Don't Breathe Into Walls**
- Last 2 strokes before the wall = NO breathing
- Last 2 strokes before finish = NO breathing
- Keeps your head down and speed up

**5. Sprint the Last 15 Yards**
- This is where you win!
- Fastest 3 strokes at the very end
- Don't slow down!

## 🐸 50 BREASTSTROKE - SPECIFIC FOCUS

**Current**: 44.10 | **Goal**: 42.09 | **Need**: -2.01 seconds

### The Secret Weapon: THE PULLOUT

**What is it**: After you push off the wall, pull your hands all the way to your hips, hold, then do ONE big kick.

**Simple explanation**:
- **"Pullout"** = a special move you do underwater in breaststroke right after you push off the wall
- It's like a super-powered underwater move that shoots you forward really far!
- **Step 1**: Push off wall in streamline (arms above head, body straight)
- **Step 2**: Pull your hands down through the water all the way to your hips (NOT to your chest - all the way to your hips!)
- **Step 3**: Hold your arms at your hips for 1 second (don't rush!)
- **Step 4**: Do ONE big breaststroke kick (the biggest kick you can!)
- **Step 5**: Glide forward underwater as far as you can before you need to breathe
- **Goal**: Surface at 12-15 feet from the wall (at or past the flags!)

**Why it's important**: A perfect pullout can save you 0.6 seconds!

### What to Focus on During Team Breaststroke Practice:

**1. Perfect Pullout**
- Push off in streamline
- Pull hands ALL the way to hips (NOT chest - hips! This is very important!)
- Hold at sides for 1 second (count "one-Mississippi")
- ONE huge breaststroke kick (the biggest kick you can do!)
- **"Glide"** = slide forward through the water without kicking or pulling, like a torpedo or rocket
- Glide as far as possible before surfacing (stay underwater as long as you can!)
- Try to surface at 12-15 feet (at or past the flags)
- **Time saved**: -0.60 seconds!

**2. Longer Glide**

**Simple explanation**:
- **"Glide"** = after each stroke, let yourself slide forward through the water for a moment before starting the next stroke
- Don't start your next stroke too fast - give yourself time to slide forward
- Think of it like sliding on ice - you push, then you slide, then you push again

**What to do**:
- After each stroke, glide forward (slide through the water)
- Don't rush the next stroke (wait a moment)
- Feel yourself moving through the water (you should feel like you're gliding forward)
- **Time saved**: -0.40 seconds!

**3. Powerful Kick**
- Heels to butt
- Feet turned OUT (like a frog)
- SNAP feet outward
- Squeeze legs together
- **Time saved**: -0.40 seconds!

**4. Quick Hands Forward**
- After you breathe, shoot hands forward fast
- Don't pause at the front
- Get back to streamline position quickly

**5. Fewer Strokes**
- Try to take 10-12 strokes total for 50 BR
- Longer glides = fewer strokes = faster time

## 🔙 50 BACKSTROKE - SPECIFIC FOCUS

**Current**: 41.60 | **Goal**: 37.59 | **Need**: -4.01 seconds

### What to Focus on During Team Backstroke Practice:

**1. Underwater Kicks (8-10 off start!)**
- Backstroke starts have the MOST underwater kicks
- Push off on your back
- 8-10 dolphin kicks underwater
- Don't breathe until 15 feet
- **Time saved**: -1.20 seconds!

**2. Fast Arm Turnover**
- Don't over-glide
- Arms should always be moving
- One arm pulls while other recovers
- Quick tempo
- **Time saved**: -1.20 seconds!

**3. High Hips**
- Keep your hips at the surface
- Head back, eyes looking UP
- Water at your ears
- Don't sit in the water
- **Time saved**: -0.80 seconds!

## 🏊 50 FREESTYLE - SPECIFIC FOCUS

**Current**: 35.15 | **Goal**: 31.09 | **Need**: -4.06 seconds

### What to Focus on During Team Freestyle Practice:

**1. Faster Stroke Rate**
- Move arms quicker
- Don't pause at the front
- Don't over-glide
- High turnover
- **Time saved**: -1.60 seconds!

**2. Underwater Kicks**
- 6-8 kicks off start
- 4-5 kicks off turn
- Fast flutter kicks
- **Time saved**: -1.00 seconds!

**3. Body Rotation**

**Simple explanation**:
- **"Body rotation"** = your body rolls from side to side as you swim freestyle
- Don't swim flat on your stomach like a surfboard - instead, roll your body to the side with each stroke
- When your right arm pulls, your body rolls to the right
- When your left arm pulls, your body rolls to the left
- **"Reach long"** = stretch your arm out as far as you can in front of you before starting your pull

**What it looks like**: Imagine you're a rolling log in the water - you roll side to side as you swim

**Time saved**: -0.50 seconds!

**4. High Elbow Catch**

**Simple explanation**:
- **"Catch"** = when your hand first grabs the water to start pulling
- **"High elbow"** = when your hand goes in the water, your elbow should be higher than your hand (bent elbow, not straight)
- Think of it like reaching over a barrel - your elbow is high, your hand is low
- **"Pull water backward"** = push the water toward your feet, not down toward the bottom of the pool
- **"Feel water on forearm"** = you should feel the water pressing against your whole forearm, not just your hand

**Time saved**: -0.50 seconds!

**5. Breathing Pattern**
- Breathe every 2 or 3 strokes (find your rhythm)
- Quick breath (don't lift head too high)
- Don't breathe last 2 strokes into walls
- **Time saved**: -0.20 seconds!

## 💯 100 BACKSTROKE - SPECIFIC FOCUS

**Current**: 1:24.00 | **Goal**: 1:19.59 | **Need**: -4.41 seconds

### The Secret: PACING (Don't go too fast on first 50!)

**Simple explanation**:
- **"Pacing"** = how fast you swim at different parts of the race
- Think of it like running a race - if you run super fast at the start, you'll be too tired at the end
- In a 100 (which is 2 laps), you want to swim the SECOND lap FASTER than the first lap
- **"Negative split"** = when your second 50 is faster than your first 50
- **"Controlled"** = not too fast, not too slow - you're swimming fast but saving some energy
- Example: If you swim first 50 in 42 seconds and second 50 in 40 seconds, that's a negative split!

**Best Strategy**:
- First 50: Controlled - around 42-43 seconds (fast but not sprinting, save energy)
- Second 50: FASTER - around 40-41 seconds (now you sprint!)
- This is called "negative split" - it's how the professional swimmers do it!

### What to Focus on During Team 100 BK Practice:

**1. Underwaters (Off Start AND Turn!)**
- Start: 8-10 kicks → reach 15 feet
- Turn: 5-6 kicks → reach 10-12 feet
- **Time saved**: -1.50 seconds!

**2. Smart Pacing**
- Don't sprint the first 50 (don't swim too fast at the beginning)
- Save energy for second 50 (keep some energy for the second lap)
- Second 50 should feel faster (that's when you speed up and sprint)
- **Time saved**: -1.20 seconds!

**3. Maintain Stroke Rate**

**Simple explanation**:
- **"Maintain stroke rate"** = keep your arms moving at the same fast speed even when you're tired
- **"Maintain tempo when tired"** = when you get tired in the second lap, your arms want to slow down - don't let them! Keep moving them fast
- It's hard, but this is what makes you fast!

**What to do**:
- When you get tired, your arms want to slow down (this is normal)
- Fight this! Keep arms moving fast (same speed as the beginning)
- Think "quick tempo" even when tired (keep that fast arm speed!)
- **Time saved**: -1.00 seconds!

**4. Fast Turn at 50**
- Quick flip
- Strong push-off
- 5-6 kicks
- Come out of turn with momentum
- **Time saved**: -0.50 seconds!

**5. Strong Last 25**
- This is where you sprint!
- Fastest arms in the whole race
- Don't breathe last 2 strokes
- **Time saved**: -0.21 seconds!

## 💯 100 FREESTYLE - SPECIFIC FOCUS

**Current**: 1:14.72 | **Goal**: 1:09.79 | **Need**: -4.93 seconds

### The Secret: PACING + ENDURANCE

**Simple explanation**:
- Same idea as 100 BK - don't go too fast at the start!
- **"Endurance"** = how long you can keep swimming fast without getting too tired
- **"Controlled fast"** = you're swimming fast, but not as fast as you can - saving some energy for the second lap
- You want your second 50 to be faster than your first 50 (negative split!)

**Best Strategy**:
- First 50: Controlled - around 37 seconds (fast but not sprinting yet)
- Second 50: Slightly faster - around 35-36 seconds (now you speed up!)

### What to Focus on During Team 100 FR Practice:

**1. Underwaters**
- Start: 6-8 kicks (dolphin kicks or flutter kicks underwater)
- Turn: 4-5 kicks (after you flip at the wall)
- **"Every underwater = free speed"** = every time you stay underwater and kick, you get faster for free!
- **Time saved**: -1.50 seconds!

**2. Smart Pacing**
- First 50 should feel "controlled fast" (fast but not sprinting - about 80% effort)
- Don't sprint too early (save your energy!)
- Save energy for second 50 (that's when you sprint!)
- **Time saved**: -1.50 seconds!

**3. Faster Stroke Rate**
- **"Quick arm turnover"** = move your arms fast, one after the other, like pedaling a bike
- **"Throughout"** = during the whole race, from start to finish
- Don't slow down when tired (when you get tired, keep your arms moving fast!)
- Keep tempo high (keep that fast arm speed!)
- **Time saved**: -1.00 seconds!

**4. Perfect Turn**
- Quick flip at 50
- Strong push-off
- Maintain momentum
- **Time saved**: -0.50 seconds!

**5. Strong Finish**
- Last 25 = FASTEST 25
- Sprint to the wall
- Don't breathe last 2-3 strokes
- **Time saved**: -0.43 seconds!
