## 🏊 DURING TEAM PRACTICES (Oct 20-26)

### Vihaan Should Focus on ONLY These 3 Things:

#### 1️⃣ **UNDERWATER DOLPHIN KICKS** (Practice Every Day!)

**What to do during team warm-up or any drill time**:
- Every time you push off a wall → 5-6 strong dolphin kicks
- Try to reach 12-15 feet before surfacing
- Make it a game: "Can I get past the flags?"

**How to practice**:
- During warm-up: Count your kicks off each wall
- During drills: Add extra kicks off every wall
- During cool-down: 4 x 25 underwater kick focus

**Goal**: By October 26, you should be able to do 6 solid kicks and reach the flags (15 feet) easily.

---

#### 2️⃣ **EXPLOSIVE STARTS** (Ask Coach for 5-10 Practice Starts)

**What to ask coach**:
"Can I practice 5 starts from the blocks after practice?"

**What to focus on**:
- Powerful leg drive off blocks
- Enter water DEEP (like diving into the water, not on top of it)
- Tight streamline (arms locked, head between arms)
- 5-6 dolphin kicks before first stroke
- Surface around the flags (15 feet)

**If coach says yes**: Practice 5-10 starts on Mon, Wed, Fri (Oct 21, 23, 25)

**If coach says no**: Mental visualization instead:
- Close your eyes
- Imagine yourself diving perfectly
- Feel the explosive push-off
- See yourself underwater with 6 strong kicks
- Visualize surfacing at the flags

**Goal**: Perfect start = save 0.15-0.20 seconds!

---

#### 3️⃣ **FAST BUTTERFLY TURNS** (Practice During Any Butterfly Set)

**What to focus on during team practice**:
- Touch wall with TWO hands at the same time
- Tuck knees FAST (like you're in a hurry)
- Plant feet on wall
- Push off hard on your side or back (not on your belly)
- Do 3-4 dolphin kicks before surfacing
- Surface at about 10 feet from the wall

**How to practice**:
- During any 50 FL or 100 FL set
- Focus on the turn MORE than the swimming
- Make each turn faster than the last one

**Goal**: Faster turn = save 0.05-0.08 seconds!

---

## 🎓 WHAT VIHAAN NEEDS TO KNOW

### The 3 Secrets to Success

**Secret #1: Underwater Kicks Save the Most Time**
- 6 kicks off the start (reach flags) = -0.15 sec
- 4 kicks off the turn (reach 10 feet) = -0.05 sec
- **Total: -0.20 seconds just from kicks!**

**Secret #2: Don't Breathe Into Walls**
- Last 2 strokes before EVERY wall = no breathing
- This keeps your speed up
- Saves: -0.05 to -0.10 seconds

**Secret #3: Sprint the Last 25 Yards**
- Many swimmers slow down at the end
- You speed UP at the end
- This is where you beat people!
- Saves: -0.05 to -0.10 seconds

---

## 💪 FINAL PEP TALK

**Vihaan**,

You only need **0.34 seconds**. That's it!

That's **less than half a second**.

You know what can give you 0.34 seconds?

1. **6 strong dolphin kicks off the start** (instead of 3-4) → -0.15 sec
2. **A faster turn** (quick touch and push) → -0.08 sec
3. **Sprinting the last 25 yards** (don't slow down!) → -0.11 sec

**Total: -0.34 seconds!**

You've practiced these things. You know how to do them. Now just do it in the race!

**Remember**:
- Have FUN! This is why you swim!
- Be BRAVE! Racing takes courage!
- Be PROUD! You've worked hard!
- Do YOUR BEST! That's all anyone can ask!

**You've got this! 🏊‍♂️💪🏆**
