---

## 🏊‍♂️ EVENT #1: 50 BREASTSTROKE

### Current Split Analysis
- **Your best**: 44.10s
- **Target**: 42.09s (need to drop 2.01 seconds)
- **Where to save time**: Pullouts (0.6s each x 2 = 1.2s) + underwater off start (0.4s) + finish sprint (0.4s)

### Race Execution Plan

**START (First 15 yards - CRITICAL)**
- ✅ Explosive dive → streamline entry
- ✅ **THE PULLOUT**: Hands pull ALL THE WAY to hips (NOT chest!)
- ✅ Hold at hips for 1 count
- ✅ ONE huge kick
- ✅ Glide until you MUST breathe (aim for 12-15 feet)
- ⚠️ **NO breathing for first 3 strokes after surfacing**

**Mid-Pool (Middle 20 yards)**
- ✅ **Long glides** - count "1-2" after each kick before next pull
- ✅ **Swim in middle of lane** - don't drift left/right
- ✅ Strong kicks (snap heels to butt)
- ✅ Pull wide, push water back hard
- ⚠️ Target: 10-12 total strokes for entire 50

**TURN (At 25 yards)**
- ✅ Touch with BOTH hands simultaneously
- ✅ Quick tuck, spin, feet on wall
- ✅ **SECOND PULLOUT**: Hands to hips again! This is where you gain time!
- ✅ Hold, one kick, glide to flags

**FINISH (Last 15 yards)**
- ✅ Maintain long glides (don't rush strokes)
- ✅ **Last 10 yards = SPRINT** - faster arms, faster kicks
- ✅ Stretch for wall - long reach on final stroke
- ✅ **TOUCH with both hands!**

### Technical Reminders
- **Bilateral breathing** (breathe every stroke, head forward not up)
- **Narrow kicks** (heels together, feet turn out, snap together)
- **Pull pattern**: Outsweep → Insweep → Hands shoot forward
- **Timing**: Pull → Breathe → Kick → Glide (in that order!)

### Race Splits to Target
- **At 25y turn**: ~22 seconds (controlled pace)
- **At finish**: 42.09s (sprint the second 25!)

## 🏊‍♂️ EVENT #2: 100 BACKSTROKE

### Current Split Analysis
- **Your best**: 1:24.00 (84 seconds)
- **Target**: 1:19.59 (79.59 seconds - need to drop 4.41 seconds)
- **Strategy**: Negative split (second 50 faster than first 50)
- **Where to save time**: Start kicks (0.8s) + turn kicks (0.6s) + pacing (1.5s) + high tempo (1.5s)

### Race Execution Plan

**START (First 15 yards)**
- ✅ Feet HIGH on wall (toes at waterline)
- ✅ **Explosive throw back and UP** (arch like a rainbow)
- ✅ Hands enter first, then head, then body
- ✅ **8-10 dolphin kicks on back** (stay on back, don't roll!)
- ✅ Surface at flags (15 feet)
- ⚠️ **NO breathing for first 3 strokes**

**First 50 (Controlled pace - 80-85% effort)**
- ✅ **Fast arm turnover** - don't over-glide (quick, quick, quick!)
- ✅ **Swim in middle of lane** - use ceiling lights/lane lines to stay straight
- ✅ Pinky enters first (rotate hand on entry)
- ✅ Pull straight down past hip (don't push out wide)
- ✅ **Minimal breathing** - only when you need it
- ✅ Steady 6-beat kick (constant, not lazy!)
- ⚠️ Target: 42-43 seconds at the 50 wall

**TURN (At 50 yards - CRITICAL)**
- ✅ **Count strokes into wall** - know when to flip
- ✅ See black T on bottom (5 yards out)
- ✅ Flip onto stomach, flip turn, push off on back
- ✅ **5-6 strong dolphin kicks** on back
- ⚠️ **NO breathing for 3 strokes off the wall**

**Second 50 (FASTER - 90-95% effort)**
- ✅ **Increase tempo** - arms move faster than first 50
- ✅ **Higher stroke rate** (count: should be 2-3 more strokes than first 50)
- ✅ Don't let arms slow down when tired!
- ✅ **Stay in middle of lane**
- ✅ Strong consistent kick
- ⚠️ Target: 40-41 seconds for this 50 (negative split!)

**FINISH (Last 15 yards)**
- ✅ **ALL OUT SPRINT** - fastest arms!
- ✅ Count strokes into wall (look for flags)
- ✅ **Don't breathe last 2 strokes**
- ✅ One extra stroke to be sure - reach back and TOUCH!

### Technical Reminders
- **Head position**: Still, look straight up (not at feet or behind you)
- **Body rotation**: Rotate shoulders 30-45° each stroke (hip drives rotation)
- **Arm recovery**: Straight arm, pinky exits first, thumb enters first
- **Kick**: Steady 6-beat, toes pointed, kick from hips
- **Breathing pattern**: Every 3-4 strokes (bilateral - alternate sides)

### Race Splits to Target
- **At 25y**: ~21 seconds
- **At 50y (split time)**: 42-43 seconds
- **At 75y**: ~1:03 seconds
- **At finish**: 1:19.59 (second 50 should be 37-38 seconds!)

## 🏊‍♂️ EVENT #3: 50 FREESTYLE

### Current Split Analysis
- **Your best**: 35.15s
- **Target**: 31.09s (need to drop 4.06 seconds)
- **Where to save time**: Start kicks (0.8s) + turn kicks (0.6s) + no breathing (1.0s) + high tempo (1.5s)

### Race Execution Plan

**START (First 15 yards - MAXIMUM EFFORT)**
- ✅ Explosive dive → streamlined entry (hands first, 45° angle)
- ✅ **5-6 flutter kicks or dolphin kicks** underwater
- ✅ Surface at or past flags (15 feet)
- ⚠️ **NO BREATHING for first 3-4 strokes** (this is critical!)

**First 25 (Sprint with control)**
- ✅ **High stroke rate** - fast arms, no pause at front (quick, quick, quick!)
- ✅ **Swim in middle of lane**
- ✅ **Minimal breathing** - bilateral every 3 or every 4 strokes (not every 2!)
- ✅ Pull straight back under body (don't push out wide)
- ✅ Strong 6-beat kick (flutter kick, toes pointed)
- ⚠️ **NO breathing last 2 strokes into wall**

**TURN (At 25 yards)**
- ✅ See the T (5 yards out, start setting up)
- ✅ **Don't breathe last 2 strokes** into wall
- ✅ Quick flip (somersault, feet on wall)
- ✅ Push off on side (not back, not stomach - 45° angle)
- ✅ **4-5 strong kicks** before surfacing
- ⚠️ **NO breathing for 3 strokes off the wall**

**Second 25 (ALL OUT SPRINT)**
- ✅ **MAXIMUM tempo** - fastest arms possible!
- ✅ Don't over-glide (hands enter and pull immediately)
- ✅ **Swim in middle of lane**
- ✅ High elbow catch, pull hard
- ✅ Kick fast (legs don't stop!)
- ⚠️ **Breathing pattern**: Every 4 strokes OR every 3 (not every 2!)

**FINISH (Last 10 yards)**
- ✅ **ABSOLUTE SPRINT** - nothing left in the tank!
- ✅ **NO BREATHING** last 3 strokes
- ✅ Long reach on last stroke
- ✅ TOUCH the wall hard!

### Technical Reminders
- **High elbow catch**: Fingertips point down, elbow stays high
- **Hand entry**: Thumb side first, reach forward and slightly out (shoulder width)
- **Pull pattern**: Catch → Pull → Push → Recovery (smooth, continuous)
- **Kick**: Constant 6-beat flutter, toes pointed, kick from hips
- **Breathing**: Quick rotation, one goggle out of water, exhale in water
- **Body rotation**: 30-45° each side (hip rotation drives power)

### Breathing Strategy (CRITICAL FOR THIS EVENT!)
- **Strategy**: Every 3 or every 4 strokes (bilateral alternating)
- **Why**: More oxygen, better balance, faster time
- **First 15 yards (off start)**: ZERO breaths
- **Middle 20 yards**: Breathe every 3-4 strokes (bilateral)
- **Last 2 strokes before turn**: NO breaths
- **First 3 strokes off turn**: NO breaths
- **Last 3 strokes to finish**: NO breaths

### Race Splits to Target
- **At 15y (off start)**: ~6-7 seconds (underwater + first strokes)
- **At 25y turn**: ~16-17 seconds
- **At finish**: 31.09s (second 25 should be 14-15 seconds!)
