- ✅ **Swim in middle of lane**
- ✅ Strong kicks (snap heels to butt, feet turn out)
- ✅ Pull wide, bring hands together, shoot forward

- ⚠️ **NO breathing for first 2 strokes off wall**

**Second 25 (Maintain pace - 85% effort)**
- ✅ **Keep long glides** (don't rush strokes when tired!)
- ✅ **Swim in middle of lane**
- ✅ Strong kick on every stroke
- ✅ Pull-breathe-kick-glide rhythm

- ⚠️ Target time: ~39-40 seconds at halfway (50y mark)

**Second Turn (At 50 yards - HALFWAY POINT)**
- ✅ Touch with BOTH hands
- ✅ Quick turn
- ✅ **THIRD PULLOUT**: Hands to hips again!
- ✅ Hold, ONE kick, glide
- ⚠️ **NO breathing first 2 strokes off wall**

- ✅ Long glides still (don't shorten!)
- ✅ Strong final kick
- ✅ Long reach on final stroke
- ✅ **TOUCH with both hands!**

### Technical Reminders
- **Pull pattern**: Outsweep (hands apart) → Insweep (hands together) → Shoot forward
- **Breathing**: Every stroke, head forward (not up), chin on water
- **Kick**: Heels to butt → feet turn out → whip together → toes pointed on glide
- **Timing**: Pull → Breathe → Kick → Glide (in that specific order!)
- **Glide**: Count "1-2" (or "one-Mississippi") before next pull
- **Narrow kick**: Heels together at start, knees shoulder-width

### Pullout Technique (4 PULLOUTS - Don't miss any!)
**Every pullout must be perfect**:
1. **Start position**: Streamline (hands stacked, arms squeezing ears)
2. **Pull phase**: Pull hands ALL THE WAY down to hips (not chest!)
3. **Hold phase**: Hold at hips for 1 count
4. **Kick phase**: ONE huge kick (biggest you can do!)
5. **Glide phase**: Glide until you MUST breathe (12-15 feet)

**Where pullouts happen**:
- Pullout #1: Off the start
- Pullout #2: Off first turn (25y)
- Pullout #3: Off second turn (50y)
- Pullout #4: Off third turn (75y)

### Pacing Strategy
**Goal**: Even pace (all 25s roughly same speed) OR slight negative split

**Recommended splits**:
- **25y**: 19-20 seconds (controlled, perfect pullout)
- **50y**: 39-40 seconds total (19-20 second split)
- **75y**: 59-61 seconds total (19-21 second split)
- **100y**: 1:18-1:22 finish (18-22 second split + sprint)

### Stroke Count Goals
- **Target**: 6-8 strokes per 25 (after pullout)
- **Total race**: 24-32 total strokes for entire 100
- **Why it matters**: Fewer strokes = longer glides = faster time!
