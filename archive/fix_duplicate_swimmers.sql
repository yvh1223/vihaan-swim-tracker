-- ========================================
-- Fix Duplicate Swimmer Records
-- ========================================
-- This script identifies and merges duplicate "Vihang" swimmer records

-- Step 1: Find all Vihang/Vihaan records
SELECT
    id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    full_name,
    current_age,
    lsc,
    club,
    active,
    created_at,
    updated_at
FROM swimmers
WHERE full_name LIKE '%Vihaan%' OR full_name LIKE '%Vihang%' OR first_name LIKE '%Vihaan%' OR first_name LIKE '%Vihang%'
ORDER BY created_at;

-- This will show us all the duplicate records and their IDs
-- Review the output to identify which ID to keep (usually the oldest with most complete data)

-- ========================================
-- Step 2: Automatic Merge (Smart Detection)
-- ========================================
-- This script automatically finds duplicates and merges them
-- It keeps the OLDEST record (first created) as the keeper
