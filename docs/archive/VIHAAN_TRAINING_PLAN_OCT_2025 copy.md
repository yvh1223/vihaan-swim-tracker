## 🏆 Final Recommendations

### Top 5 Training Priorities

1. **UNDERWATER KICKS** - Practice EVERY day (biggest time saver across all events)
2. **STARTS** - 10 practice starts per session, 3x per week
3. **TURNS** - Perfect turns in every practice set
4. **STROKE RATE** - Work on fast hands without sacrificing distance
5. **RACE PACING** - Learn to negative split 100s

### Equipment Recommendations

- **Fins** (for underwater kick practice)
- **Kickboard** (for isolated kick work)
- **Pull Buoy** (for arm strength)
- **Snorkel** (for technique work without breathing disruption)
- **Tempo Trainer** (to work on consistent stroke rates)

### Nutrition & Recovery

- **Hydration**: Drink water before, during, and after practice
- **Protein**: Lean protein after practice for recovery
- **Sleep**: 9-10 hours per night (crucial for 10-year-olds)
- **Stretching**: 10 min after every practice

### Competition Strategy

- **Warm-up**: 400-600 yards before racing
- **Visualization**: 5 minutes of mental rehearsal
- **Confidence**: Remember your training - you're prepared!
