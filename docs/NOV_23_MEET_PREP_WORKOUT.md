## RACE STRATEGY: 200 BACKSTROKE

### Pacing Strategy (4 x 50 splits)
| 50 | Target Time | Effort Level | Focus |
|----|-------------|--------------|-------|
| 1st 50 | ~43 sec | 80% | Strong start, 10 UW kicks, find rhythm |
| 2nd 50 | ~45 sec | 85% | Maintain tempo, 6 UW kicks, stay relaxed |
| 3rd 50 | ~46 sec | 90% | Don't die! Keep arms moving fast |
| 4th 50 | ~46 sec | 100% | SPRINT home, no breathing last 5 strokes |

### Key Technique Reminders
1. **Underwater kicks**: 8-10 off start, 5-6 off each turn
2. **Fast arms**: Keep turnover quick, don't glide
3. **High hips**: Belly at surface, don't sit in water
4. **Breathe**: Every 3-4 arm strokes
5. **Finish**: Accelerate last 25, touch on back

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Going out too fast first 50 (you'll die at 150)
- Weak underwater kicks
- Slowing arm tempo when tired
- Short-stroking (keep full strokes)

## RACE STRATEGY: 200 BREASTSTROKE

### Pacing Strategy (4 x 50 splits)
| 50 | Target Time | Effort Level | Focus |
|----|-------------|--------------|-------|
| 1st 50 | ~50 sec | 80% | Strong start, PERFECT pullout, find glide |
| 2nd 50 | ~54 sec | 85% | Maintain stroke count, long glide |
| 3rd 50 | ~55 sec | 90% | Don't rush! Keep glide, stay efficient |
| 4th 50 | ~55 sec | 100% | SPRINT home, attack each stroke |

### Key Technique Reminders
1. **PULLOUT**: Hands to HIPS (not chest!), hold 1 sec, ONE big kick
2. **Glide**: After each stroke, let yourself GLIDE forward
3. **Powerful kick**: Heels to butt, feet OUT, SNAP together
4. **Stroke count**: 8-10 strokes per 50 (fewer = more efficient)
5. **Head position**: Look down during glide, forward only to breathe

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Rushing strokes (killing your glide)
- Weak pullouts (leaving time on the table)
- Short kicks (need FULL kick every time)
- Pulling hands to chest instead of hips on pullout

## PARENT NOTES - WHAT TO WATCH FOR

### During Warm-Up
- Is he getting loose and moving well?
- Are his underwater kicks happening every wall?
- Is he doing the drills correctly?

### During Backstroke Sets
**Good Signs**:
- Long underwater kicks (5-6 minimum) off each wall
- Arms moving continuously (no pauses)
- Hips at surface (not sinking)
- Even breathing rhythm
- Negative splits on 100s (second 50 faster)

**Warning Signs**:
- Coming up too early off walls (less than 5 kicks)
- Arms slowing down or pausing
- Hips dropping (sitting in water)
- Erratic stroke rhythm
- Second 50 much slower than first 50

### During Breaststroke Sets
**Good Signs**:
- Perfect pullouts: hands to HIPS, hold, big kick
- Surfacing at flags (12-15 feet from wall)
- Long glide between each stroke
- Powerful snap kick
- Stroke count 8-10 per 50

**Warning Signs**:
- Hands only going to chest on pullout
- Surfacing too early (less than 10 feet)
- Rushing strokes (no glide)
- Weak kick (no snap)
- Too many strokes (12+ per 50)

### During 200 Simulations
**Good Signs**:
- First 50 is controlled, not sprinting
- Maintaining technique on 3rd 50 (hardest 50!)
- Finishing strong on 4th 50
- Splits within 2-3 seconds of each other

**Warning Signs**:
- First 50 way too fast (will die later)
- 3rd 50 is 5+ seconds slower (poor pacing)
- Technique falling apart when tired
- Giving up before the finish

## MENTAL PREPARATION

### Tonight Before Bed
- Visualize the race from start to finish
- See yourself doing perfect underwaters and pullouts
- Imagine feeling strong on the 3rd 50
- Picture yourself sprinting the last 25

### Tomorrow Morning
- Light breakfast 2-3 hours before race
- Stay hydrated
- Keep moving - don't sit around getting cold
- Listen to music if it helps

### Before Each Race
- 200 Back: "8-10 kicks off start, fast arms, negative split"
- 200 Breast: "Perfect pullout, long glide, powerful kick"

### During the Race
- 1st 50: "Controlled, find my rhythm"
- 2nd 50: "Stay relaxed, maintain technique"
- 3rd 50: "Don't panic, keep moving"
- 4th 50: "NOW I GO! Sprint home!"
