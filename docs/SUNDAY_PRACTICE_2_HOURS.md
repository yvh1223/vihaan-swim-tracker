## ⏱️ 2-HOUR PRACTICE PLAN

### Part 1: Warm-Up (15 min)

**Purpose**: Get muscles warm and loose, prevent injury, get ready to work hard.

**How to do it**:
- [ ] **300 yards easy freestyle**
  - **What "300 yards" means**: 12 lengths of a 25-yard pool (down and back 6 times)
  - **What "easy" means**: Vihaan should be able to talk while swimming - not fast, just comfortable
  - **Parent**: Just let him swim at his own pace, no timing needed
  - **Takes about**: 5-7 minutes

- [ ] **4 x 50 choice** (mix of strokes - BR, FR, BK)
  - **What this means**: Swim 50 yards (2 lengths) 4 times, resting between each one
  - **"Choice"** = Vihaan picks which stroke: breaststroke, freestyle, or backstroke
  - **Mix it up**: Maybe 1 BR, 1 FR, 1 BK, 1 FR (his choice!)
  - **Rest**: About 15-20 seconds between each 50
  - **Parent**: Time each 50 if you want, but this is just warm-up - shouldn't be fast
  - **Takes about**: 5 minutes

- [ ] **4 x 25** (1 BR, 1 FR, 1 BK, 1 choice)
  - **What this means**: Swim 25 yards (1 length) 4 times
  - Do 1 length breaststroke, 1 length freestyle, 1 length backstroke, 1 length any stroke
  - **Rest**: 10-15 seconds between each
  - **Takes about**: 3 minutes

**Total warm-up time**: About 15 minutes

---

### Part 2: UNDERWATER KICKS (30 min) ⭐ MOST IMPORTANT!

**Why this is so important**: Underwater kicks save more time than anything else! This is where Vihaan can gain 0.5 to 1.5 seconds per race!

**What "underwater kicks" means**:
- After pushing off the wall, Vihaan stays underwater and does dolphin kicks (both legs move together up and down, like a mermaid tail)
- **"Streamline position"**: Arms straight above head, one hand stacked on top of the other, arms squeezing his ears tightly, body perfectly straight like an arrow
- **"The flags"**: Those triangle-shaped flags hanging over the pool about 15 feet (5 yards) from each wall
- **Goal**: Stay underwater kicking and reach the flags before coming up to breathe!

---

**SET 1: With fins** (if you have them) - Makes it easier to practice

- [ ] **10 x 15 yards underwater kick on :45**

**How to do it (for Vihaan)**:
1. Start at the wall
2. Get in perfect streamline position (hands stacked, arms squeezing ears)
3. Push off the wall HARD on your stomach
4. Do dolphin kicks (both legs together, kick from your hips, not just your knees)
5. Count in your head: 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8 kicks
6. Try to reach the flags (15 feet) before you breathe
7. When you MUST breathe, come up
8. Swim to the other wall (or get out and walk back)
9. **Rest 45 seconds from when you started** (not from when you finished)
10. Repeat 10 times

**Parent's job**:
- Stand at the 15-foot mark (at the flags) so Vihaan can see where to aim
- Count his kicks OUT LOUD as he's underwater: "ONE! TWO! THREE! FOUR! FIVE! SIX!"
- Watch him start the timer (or you start it when he pushes off)
- When he surfaces, tell him: "Great! You did 6 kicks!" or "You made it to the flags!"
- If he doesn't reach the flags, say: "Good effort! Try to get one kick further next time!"
- Use your phone's stopwatch - start it when he pushes off, when it hits 45 seconds, he starts the next one

**What good technique looks like**:
- ✅ Arms perfectly straight and squeezed tight to ears (no gap between arms and head)
- ✅ Body in a straight line (no pike/bent at waist)
- ✅ Kicks coming from the hips (whole legs moving, not just from knees)
- ✅ Staying at least 1-2 feet underwater (not at the surface)

**Common mistakes to watch for**:
- ❌ Arms not squeezed to ears (creates drag)
- ❌ Head lifted up (should be down between arms)
- ❌ Kicking only from the knees (should kick from hips with whole leg)
- ❌ Coming up too early (before 15 feet)

---

- [ ] **4 x 25 freestyle with 5 kicks off each wall on :45**

**How to do it (for Vihaan)**:
1. Swim 25 yards (one length) easy freestyle
2. At EACH wall (start and finish), do exactly 5 underwater kicks before you start swimming
3. Count them: 1-2-3-4-5, then start swimming
4. Rest 45 seconds between each one

**Parent's job**:
- Watch the start: Count his kicks - "1-2-3-4-5!"
- Watch the finish: Count his kicks again when he reaches the other end
- Say: "I saw 5 kicks off the start! Good! Did you do 5 at the finish too?"
- Make sure he's doing the kicks BEFORE he starts swimming (not mixing kicks and strokes)

---

- [ ] **4 x 25 backstroke with 6 kicks off each wall on :45**

**How to do it (for Vihaan)**:
1. Swim 25 yards (one length) easy backstroke
2. At EACH wall, do exactly 6 underwater kicks ON YOUR BACK before you start swimming
3. Count them: 1-2-3-4-5-6, then start swimming
4. Rest 45 seconds between each one

**Parent's job**:
- Watch him push off the wall on his back
- Count his kicks: "1-2-3-4-5-6!"
- Make sure he stays on his back for the kicks (common mistake: rolling to stomach)

---

**SET 2: Without fins** (race conditions - this is harder!)

- [ ] **8 x 15 yards underwater kick on :60**

**How to do it (for Vihaan)**:
- Same as the fins set, but WITHOUT fins
- Push off, streamline, kick as far as you can
- Goal: 5-6 solid kicks, try to reach 12-15 feet
- Rest 60 seconds between each one (more rest because it's harder without fins)

**Parent's job**:
- Same as before: stand at the flags, count kicks
- This will be harder - he won't go as far without fins
- **Encouragement is important here!** Say: "Great job! You're getting stronger!"
- If he only gets 10 feet, that's okay - he's learning!

**Takes about**: 30 minutes total

---

### Part 3: STARTS FROM BLOCKS (25 min) ⭐ CRITICAL!

**Why this is so important**: A good start can save 0.3 to 0.7 seconds! This is huge in a 50-yard race!

---

**FREESTYLE/BREASTSTROKE STARTS** (front dive from blocks)

- [ ] **5-7 freestyle starts**

**How to do it (for Vihaan)**:
1. Stand on the starting block (or edge of pool if no blocks)
2. Toes at the edge, feet about shoulder-width apart
3. Bend down and grab the front edge of the block with your hands
4. When ready, say "GO!" to yourself
5. **PUSH HARD with your legs** (like jumping forward as far as you can!)
6. Throw your arms forward and point them like an arrow
7. **Enter the water at an angle** - aim to go DOWN into the water, not flat like a belly flop
8. As soon as you enter, get into tight streamline (hands stacked, arms squeezing ears)
9. Do 5-6 flutter kicks (fast small kicks) OR dolphin kicks
10. When you reach about 15 feet (the flags), start swimming
11. Get out, walk back, rest about 60 seconds, repeat

**Parent's job (VERY IMPORTANT)**:
- **Safety first**: If using starting blocks, make sure the pool is deep enough (at least 6 feet). If not deep enough, practice from the side of the pool pushing off.
- Stand where you can see him enter the water
- Watch for these things:

**What GOOD entry looks like**:
- ✅ Enters water hands-first at about a 45-degree angle (like an arrow going into the water)
- ✅ Body stays tight and straight as he enters
- ✅ Makes a small splash (not a big belly flop splash)
- ✅ You can see him streamline underwater right away
- ✅ Surfaces at or past the flags (15 feet)

**What BAD entry looks like** (things to correct):
- ❌ Enters flat (belly flop) - water splashes everywhere
- ❌ Feet enter before hands (diving too upward)
- ❌ Arms not straight when entering
- ❌ Comes up too early (before 10 feet)

**What to say**:
- If good: "Perfect! You entered like an arrow! I saw 6 kicks!"
- If needs work: "Good push off! Next time, try to enter the water a little deeper - point your hands down more"

**Timing**: Use your phone stopwatch
- Start: When he leaves the block (feet leave)
- Stop: When his head breaks the surface to breathe
- **Goal time**: 4-5 seconds from start to surface
- Tell him his time: "That was 4.5 seconds! Great!"

---

- [ ] **5-7 breaststroke starts**

**How to do it (for Vihaan)**:
1. Same dive as freestyle (steps 1-7 above)
2. After entering the water in streamline, here's the IMPORTANT PART:
3. **THE PULLOUT** (this is special for breaststroke):
   - Pull your hands down through the water ALL THE WAY to your hips (not to your chest!)
   - Hold your hands at your hips for 1 second
   - Do ONE big breaststroke kick (the biggest kick you can!)
   - Glide forward underwater as far as possible
   - When you MUST breathe, surface (should be 12-15 feet)
4. Take 1-2 strokes of breaststroke to finish

**Parent's job**:
- Watch for the pullout underwater (you should be able to see it if the water is clear)
- Make sure his hands go to his HIPS, not his chest (this is VERY important!)
- Time from start to surface: should be 5-6 seconds (longer than freestyle because of the pullout)
- Count to see if he does ONE kick, not two (common mistake)
- Tell him: "Great pullout! I saw your hands go to your hips!" or "Next time, try to pull all the way to your hips!"

---

**BACKSTROKE STARTS** (from in the water)

- [ ] **5-7 backstroke starts**

**How to do it (for Vihaan)**:
1. Start IN the water (not on the blocks)
2. Face the wall, holding the starting grips (or edge of pool)
3. Place your feet HIGH on the wall - toes should be right at the waterline or just below
4. Knees bent, arms holding the wall
5. When ready, say "GO!" to yourself
6. **Let go of the wall and throw your arms and head BACK and UP** (like you're trying to jump over something behind you)
7. **Arch your back** as you go backward
8. Hands should enter the water first (not your head or back)
9. Immediately get into streamline position underwater
10. Do 8-10 dolphin kicks ON YOUR BACK (don't roll over!)
11. When you reach 15 feet (the flags), start swimming backstroke

**Parent's job**:
- This is the hardest start to watch because he's going backward!
- Stand behind where he'll land so you can see

**What GOOD backstroke start looks like**:
- ✅ Throws head back and UP (not just back - needs to go UP too)
- ✅ Arches his back in the air (body looks like a backward "C")
- ✅ Hands enter water first (then head, then body)
- ✅ You see him kick underwater for a good distance (should see his feet moving underwater)
- ✅ Surfaces at 15 feet or beyond

**Common mistakes**:
- ❌ Just falls backward (not enough UP - ends up going straight back and down)
- ❌ Head enters first instead of hands (needs more arch)
- ❌ Doesn't kick enough underwater (comes up too soon)
- ❌ Rolls over to stomach underwater (should stay on back)

**What to say**:
- "Great arch! You looked like a rainbow!"
- "I saw 10 kicks! Excellent!"
- "Next time, try to throw your head back AND up more - like you're jumping over a hurdle backward"

**Timing**:
- Start when he lets go of the wall
- Stop when he surfaces
- **Goal**: 5-6 seconds

**Takes about**: 25 minutes total (with walking back and resting between starts)

---

### Part 4: BREASTSTROKE - PULLOUT FOCUS (20 min)

**The pullout saves the most time in breaststroke!**

**What "pullout" means**:
- A special underwater move for breaststroke that shoots you forward really far
- **Step 1**: Push off wall in streamline (arms above head)
- **Step 2**: Pull hands down to HIPS (not chest - hips!)
- **Step 3**: Hold arms at your hips for 1 second
- **Step 4**: Do ONE huge breaststroke kick
- **Step 5**: **"Glide"** = slide forward like a torpedo without kicking or pulling
- **Goal**: Surface at 12-15 feet (at the flags!)

**Pullout Practice**:
- [ ] **8 x 25 BR - pullout focus on :50**
  - Push off in streamline (arms above head, body straight)
  - Big pull to hips (NOT chest - pull all the way to your hips!)
  - Hold at sides 1 second (count "one-Mississippi")
  - ONE explosive kick (biggest kick you can do!)
  - Glide until you MUST breathe (slide forward like a rocket!)
  - Surface at 12-15 feet (try to reach the flags!)
  - Take 1-2 strokes to wall

**Breaststroke Sets**:
- [ ] **4 x 50 BR on 1:30**

**How to do it (for Vihaan)**:
1. Swim 50 yards (2 lengths) breaststroke
2. Focus on taking LONG GLIDES after each stroke
3. **What "long glide" means**: After you finish your kick and your hands shoot forward, WAIT a moment and let yourself slide forward before starting the next stroke. Don't rush!
4. Try to count your strokes - goal is 10-12 strokes total for the whole 50
5. Rest 1 minute 30 seconds between each 50 (Vihaan can rest or you can time it)
6. Repeat 4 times

**Parent's job**:
- Count his strokes out loud for one of the 50s (just to see how many he takes)
- Tell him: "You took 11 strokes - that's great!" or "You took 14 strokes - let's try for 12 next time with longer glides"
- Watch for the glide: after he kicks, he should slide forward for a moment before pulling again
- Time him if you want (should be around 50-60 seconds per 50)

---

- [ ] **2 x 50 BR at race pace on 2:00**

**How to do it (for Vihaan)**:
1. This is faster than the last set!
2. **"Race pace"** = swim at about 85% of how fast you can go (pretty fast, but not ALL OUT yet)
3. Start: Do perfect pullout (hands to hips, hold, one kick, glide)
4. Swim to the wall with good breaststroke
5. Turn: Touch with both hands, turn around, push off
6. Do ANOTHER perfect pullout off the turn!
7. Finish the second 25
8. Rest 2 minutes between the two 50s

**Parent's job**:
- TIME these 50s! Write down the times
- Watch BOTH pullouts (one off start, one off turn)
- Make sure hands go to hips both times
- Expected time: somewhere around 45-55 seconds depending on his current level
- Tell him his time and give feedback: "That was 48 seconds! Great job! Your pullout looked good!"

**Takes about**: 20 minutes

---

### Part 5: BACKSTROKE (20 min)

**Practice both 50 BK and 100 BK**

**50 BK Focus** (speed):
- [ ] **4 x 50 BK on 1:15**
  - First 25: Fast arms (quick turnover)
  - Second 25: Sprint
  - Focus: Don't over-glide, keep arms moving

**100 BK Focus** (pacing):

**What "pacing" and "negative split" mean**:
- **"Pacing"** = how fast you swim at different parts of the race
- **"Controlled"** = swimming fast but not sprinting - saving some energy (about 80% effort)
- **"Negative split"** = your second 50 is faster than your first 50
- Example: If first 50 is 42 seconds and second 50 is 40 seconds, that's a negative split!
- This is how professional swimmers race - don't go too fast at the start!

- [ ] **3 x 100 BK on 2:30**
  - First 50: Controlled - 42-43 sec feel (fast but not sprinting, save energy)
  - Second 50: Faster - 40-41 sec feel (now you sprint!)
  - Practice negative split pacing (second 50 faster than first 50)

**Backstroke Turns**:
- [ ] **4 x 50 BK - turn focus on 1:30**
  - Flip onto stomach before wall
  - Quick flip
  - Push off on back
  - 5-6 kicks before surfacing

**Parent**: Time the 100s, call out split times at 50!

---

### Part 6: FREESTYLE (20 min)

**Practice both 50 FR and 100 FR**

**50 FR Focus** (speed):
- [ ] **6 x 50 FR on 1:15**
  - Fast stroke rate (quick arms)
  - High tempo, no pausing
  - Don't over-glide

**100 FR Focus** (pacing):

**Same pacing idea as 100 BK**:
- First 50: Controlled (don't sprint too early!)
- Second 50: Faster (now you sprint!)
- **"Maintain stroke rate when tired"** = when you get tired, keep your arms moving fast - don't let them slow down!

- [ ] **3 x 100 FR on 2:15**
  - First 50: Controlled - 37 sec feel (fast but saving energy)
  - Second 50: Build speed - 35-36 sec feel (speed up and sprint!)
  - Maintain stroke rate when tired (keep arms moving fast even when tired!)

**Freestyle Turns**:
- [ ] **4 x 50 FR - turn focus on 1:15**
  - Don't breathe last 2 strokes into wall
  - Quick flip
  - Push off hard
  - 4-5 kicks before surfacing

**Parent**: Time the 100s, call out split times at 50!

---

### Part 7: RACE SIMULATIONS (20 min) ⭐ THE REAL DEAL!

**Why this is THE MOST IMPORTANT part**: These are practice races! This is where you see if all the practice work is paying off!

**How race simulations work**:
- Vihaan swims each event as if it's the real meet
- You time each race carefully
- He rests a lot between each one (3-4 minutes) so he can give 100% effort
- These times will tell you how ready he is for the Nov 1-2 meet!

---

**RACE #1: 50 BREASTSTROKE ALL OUT**

- [ ] **1 x 50 BR ALL OUT**

**How to do it (for Vihaan)**:
1. Start from the blocks (or push off wall) - this is a REAL race simulation
2. Dive in and do your BEST pullout (hands to hips, hold, ONE kick, glide)
3. Swim breaststroke to the wall as fast as you can (but with good technique!)
4. Turn: Touch with both hands, quick turn, push off
5. Do another PERFECT pullout off the turn
6. Sprint the last 15 yards (last 3-4 strokes = FASTEST!)
7. TOUCH the wall!

**Parent's job (VERY IMPORTANT)**:
- **Timing**: Have your phone ready with stopwatch
- Start timer: When he leaves the blocks (or pushes off wall)
- Stop timer: When his hand touches the wall at the finish
- **Write down the time immediately!** (in seconds)
- Watch for:
  - Did he do a good pullout off the start? (hands to hips?)
  - Did he do a good pullout off the turn? (hands to hips?)
  - Did he sprint at the end?
- After he's done, tell him the time: "You did 50 BR in 47.2 seconds!"
- Compare to his current time (44.10) - is he close? Faster? Slower?
- Give specific feedback: "Great job! Your pullouts looked perfect! That's only 3 seconds slower than your best time!"

**Rest 3 minutes before next race** (Vihaan can sit down, drink water, catch his breath)

---

**RACE #2: 50 FREESTYLE ALL OUT**

- [ ] **1 x 50 FR ALL OUT**

**How to do it (for Vihaan)**:
1. Start from blocks - explosive dive!
2. Enter water deep, streamline, do 5-6 kicks underwater
3. Surface and swim FAST freestyle to the wall
4. Don't breathe last 2 strokes before the turn
5. Quick flip turn, push off hard, 4-5 kicks
6. SPRINT the second 25 (especially last 10 yards!)
7. Don't breathe last 2 strokes into the finish!
8. TOUCH!

**Parent's job**:
- Time from start to finish (when hand touches wall)
- Watch for:
  - Did he do 5-6 kicks off the start?
  - Did he do a quick flip turn?
  - Did he do 4-5 kicks off the turn?
  - Did he sprint the finish?
- Write down time: "50 FR: _____ seconds"
- Current time is 35.15 - compare!
- Feedback: "You did ___! Your underwater kicks looked great! Your turn was super fast!"

**Rest 3 minutes**

---

**RACE #3: 50 BACKSTROKE ALL OUT**

- [ ] **1 x 50 BK ALL OUT**

**How to do it (for Vihaan)**:
1. Backstroke start from the wall
2. Throw head back and UP, arch, hands enter first
3. 8-10 dolphin kicks underwater on your back
4. Surface and swim FAST backstroke arms (don't over-glide!)
5. Flip turn at the wall (flip onto stomach, quick flip, push off on back)
6. 5-6 kicks after the turn
7. Sprint to the finish!
8. TOUCH!

**Parent's job**:
- Time from when he lets go of wall to when he touches at finish
- Watch for:
  - Good backstroke start? (arch, hands first?)
  - 8-10 kicks off start?
  - Fast arms throughout?
  - 5-6 kicks off turn?
- Write down time: "50 BK: _____ seconds"
- Current time is 41.60 - compare!
- Feedback: "You did ___! I counted 9 kicks off your start - excellent!"

**Rest 4 minutes** (100s are longer, need more rest)

---

**RACE #4: 100 BACKSTROKE ALL OUT**

- [ ] **1 x 100 BK ALL OUT**

**How to do it (for Vihaan)**:
1. Backstroke start
2. First 50: Swim CONTROLLED (not all-out sprint, save energy) - about 42-43 second feel
3. Turn at 50: Quick flip, 5-6 kicks
4. Second 50: NOW you SPRINT! This should feel faster than the first 50!
5. Sprint the last 25 (fastest arms!)
6. TOUCH!

**Parent's job (THIS IS COMPLEX - PAY ATTENTION)**:
- You need TWO times: one at 50 yards, one at finish
- **Split time at 50**: When he touches the wall the FIRST time (after 2 lengths), look at your stopwatch and REMEMBER that time - this is his "split" - but keep the timer running!
- **Final time**: When he touches the wall at the END (after 4 lengths), stop the timer - this is his final time
- Math: Subtract the split from the final to get his second 50 time
- Example:
  - Split at 50: 42.5 seconds (first 50)
  - Final time: 1:23.0 (1 minute 23 seconds total)
  - Second 50: 40.5 seconds (faster than first 50 - this is good!)
- Write down BOTH: "100 BK: Split 50: _____ Final: _____"
- Check: Is the second 50 faster than the first 50? (negative split = good!)
- Current time is 1:24.00 - compare!
- Feedback: "You did ___! Your first 50 was ___ and your second 50 was ___ - great negative split!"

**Rest 4 minutes**

---

**RACE #5: 100 FREESTYLE ALL OUT**

- [ ] **1 x 100 FR ALL OUT**

**How to do it (for Vihaan)**:
1. Freestyle start from blocks
2. First 50: CONTROLLED (around 37 second feel, don't go too fast!)
3. Turn at 50: Quick flip, 4-5 kicks
4. Second 50: Build speed! Faster than first 50!
5. Last 25: SPRINT! (Fastest arms!)
6. TOUCH!

**Parent's job**:
- Same as 100 BK: Get split time at 50, final time at finish
- Write down BOTH: "100 FR: Split 50: _____ Final: _____"
- Calculate second 50 time
- Is second 50 faster than first 50? (Should be!)
- Current time is 1:14.72 - compare!
- Feedback: "You did ___! You had a great negative split - second 50 was faster!"

---

**After ALL race simulations are done**:

**Parent - Write down all times here**:
- 50 BR: __________ seconds
- 50 FR: __________ seconds
- 50 BK: __________ seconds
- 100 BK: First 50: _____ Second 50: _____ Total: _____
